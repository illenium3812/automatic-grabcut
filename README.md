# automatic-grabcut
Grabcut is semi automatic algorithm for image segmentation of background and foreground. Aim of this project is to convert it from semi automatic  to fully automatic without any user interaction by using different image processing techniques. I am using largest contour extraction and cascade detection models in this project to achieve excellent results.
